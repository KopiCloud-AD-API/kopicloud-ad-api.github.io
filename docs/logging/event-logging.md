# Event Logging
[![KopiCloud_AD_API](https://img.shields.io/badge/kopiCloud_ad-v1.0+-blueviolet.svg)](https://www.kopicloud-ad-api.com)

An event is logged each time an API method is invoked.

These event logs are used to **audit actions performed by the API** so you know who and when they call any API method.

All the information is stored in a database and can be exported to your favorite SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) software.
