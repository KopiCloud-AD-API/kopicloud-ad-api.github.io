The API is licensed in two ways: subscription mode or perpetual license.

The subscription mode is recommended to evaluate the product or short-term projects, and the perpetual license is recommended for long-term projects.

<br /><br />

- **Subscription Mode:** recommended to evaluate the product or short-term projects. You can cancel your subscription anytime. Reduce your upfront costs and pay a low regular monthly or yearly fee.

- **Perpetual License:** recommended for long-term projects when you will invest in software integration. You pay upfront the cost of the license. However, you get a discount on the price and no extra maintenance fees.

## Licensed per Active Directory Domain

The API requires one API server per Active Directory Domain, so you must purchase one license per Active Directory Domain.
If you have two environments: development and production, you must purchase two licenses, one for each environment.
