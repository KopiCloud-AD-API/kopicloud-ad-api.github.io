## Subscription Mode or Perpetual License
    
![License Type](https://adapihelp.kopicloud.com.com/assets/docs/license-subscription.png){ align=left }

The API is licensed in two ways: subscription mode or perpetual license.

The subscription mode is recommended to evaluate the product or short-term projects, and the perpetual license is recommended for long-term projects.

<br />

- **Subscription Mode:** recommended to evaluate the product or short-term projects. You can cancel your subscription anytime. Reduce your upfront costs and pay a low regular monthly or yearly fee.

- **Perpetual License:** recommended for long-term projects when you will invest in software integration. You pay upfront the cost of the license. However, you get a discount on the price and no extra maintenance fees.

-----

## Licensed per Active Directory Domain

![Active Directory](https://adapihelp.kopicloud.com.com/assets/docs/license-ad-domain.png){ align=left }

The API requires one API server per Active Directory Domain, so you must purchase one license per Active Directory Domain.

If you have two environments: development and production, you must purchase two licenses, one for each environment.

-----

## FREE Upgrades

Your API server must connect to the internet to use our subscription mode licensing. Once a day, the server will contact our licensing API to validate our license.

You must purchase a perpetual license if you need to run our API in an environment without internet access.

## Refund and Cancellation Policy

![Refund](https://adapihelp.kopicloud.com.com/assets/docs/license-refund.png){ align=left }

We provide a trial version to let you evaluate the product to ensure it meets your needs before making a purchase. If you need any assistance or have questions during the trial, we are here to help.

After purchase, if you have an issue or are unsatisfied, please contact support; we can help you resolve any problem with the product.

We cannot offer refunds at this moment, so please start with the monthly subscription. You can always cancel every month if you are unsure.

You can upgrade your license from a monthly to a yearly subscription or perpetual license. Also, you can downgrade from a yearly to a monthly subscription at the end of your period.
