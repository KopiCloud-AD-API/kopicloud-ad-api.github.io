# Active Directory as Code

Use **KopiCloud AD Terraform Provider** to automate your Active Directory and Microsoft DNS tasks in the public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).

![azure-gcp-aws-terraform](https://help.kopicloud-ad-api.com/assets/docs/logos-azure-gcp-aws-terraform.png "Active Directory as Code with Terraform")

We developed a Terraform Provider to interact with the KopiCloud AD API from your IaC code and CI/CD pipelines.

# Set up the Terraform Provider

Login to the **KopiCloud AD API Management Website** and generate a [Authentication Token](../authentication/token-authentication.md).
