- The user is NOT a member of the Active Directory domain admins or [KopiCloud AD API authentication groups](../security/matrix.md).

- The [DNS Configuration](../settings/dns-config.md) is not correct in the settings file.

- The [Service Account Configuration](../settings/service-account.md) is not correct in the settings file.
